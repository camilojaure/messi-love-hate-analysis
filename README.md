# Messi Love & Hate Analysis

This project, conducted in 2019, explores the polarization (or "grieta" in spanish) in public sentiment surrounding Lionel Messi in Argentina, particularly after the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The analysis was commissioned by a sponsor concerned about associating its brand with Messi's image due to perceived societal division around his persona.

## **Research Question**
Does a polarization exist in the public discourse about Messi? Specifically:
1. Are there two distinct topics of conversationâ€”one predominantly positive and one predominantly negative?
2. Can we observe a balance in the frequency of positive vs. negative sentiment, and are certain semantic associations tied to subplots or narratives about Messi?

## **Approach**
The project is structured into three main analyses:
1. **Exploratory Topic Modeling**  
   Detect whether the conversation splits into two dominant topics: one supportive and one critical of Messi.
2. **Sentiment Analysis**  
   Measure the balance between positive and negative sentiment, and identify semantic links between sentiment and specific narratives.
3. **GPT-Powered Insights**  
   Use GPT to simulate an analysis and compare its findings to the original 2019 results.

## **Dataset**
- **Source:** Comments from the last 10 Instagram posts by Lionel Messi featuring him in an Argentina jersey (2018-2019).
- **Size:** Approximately 400,000 comments.

## **Project Structure**
1. **Exploratory Analysis and Topic Detection:** Initial analysis to identify potential polarization.
2. **Sentiment Analysis:** Breakdown of public sentiment into positive and negative components.
3. **GPT Analysis (Post-hoc):** A modern revisit of the data using advanced NLP tools available today.
